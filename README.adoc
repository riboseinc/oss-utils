This is a collection of utilities supporting the creation and maintenance of
Ribose open source projects.

=== Installation

Currently, there is no installation instruction except to copy and paste the
files to `$PATH` and running `chmod +x` on them.

This is expected to change once there's a clearer understanding of how these
utilities should be maintained.

TODO: Need a way to organize these files.

=== Usage

TODO: Move these instructions into their respective README files.
